# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics in the SwapKr React + Vite application following the official Vercel documentation for React applications.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
- **client/src/main.jsx** - Added the `<Analytics />` component to the main app rendering

## Implementation Details

The `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.6.1) was already installed in the project's dependencies. I added the Analytics component to the main application entry point following the React implementation pattern from the Vercel Web Analytics documentation.

### What Was Changed:
1. Modified `client/src/main.jsx` to wrap the App component with a React fragment and include the `<Analytics />` component
2. The Analytics import was already present but not being used - now it's properly integrated

### Code Changes:
```jsx
// Before:
createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(<App />);

// After:
createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <>
    <App />
    <Analytics />
  </>
);
```

## Testing & Validation

All verification steps completed successfully:

1. ✅ **Dependencies**: Already installed, no additional packages needed
2. ✅ **Build**: Ran `npm install` and `npm run build` - build completed successfully
3. ✅ **Linting**: Ran `npm run lint` - no new errors introduced (only pre-existing warnings)
4. ✅ **Tests**: Ran `npm test` - all tests pass (1/1)

## Implementation Notes

- This is a React + Vite application, so I followed the `create-react-app` pattern from the documentation
- The Analytics component is placed at the root level to track all page views and visitors across the application
- The implementation uses `@vercel/analytics/react` which provides seamless integration with React Router (already in use in this project)
- Once deployed to Vercel, analytics data will be available in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab
- The analytics will track visitors and page views via requests to `/_vercel/insights/view`

## Next Steps for Deployment

To see the analytics in action:
1. Deploy the application to Vercel using `vercel deploy` or by connecting the Git repository
2. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Analytics tab → Enable)
3. Visit the deployed application to generate analytics data
4. View the data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab
